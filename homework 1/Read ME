This folder in this repository is for the homework 1 assignment in MAE 263F

Author: Logan Hall
Date: October 18, 2023
Class: MAE 263F

The files are uploaded such that there are three files that implement each problem.

The first problem is Problem1.m
-Execution of this Problem simulates the motion of three connected spheres falling inside viscous fluid.

The second problem is Problem2.m
-Execution of this Problem simulates the motion of N-connected spheres falling inside viscous fluid.

The third and final problem is Problem3.m
-Execution of this Problem simulates the deformation of elastic beams and performs a comparison with Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.

The code in each of these three problems is written in sections, such that individual sections can be run one at a time to address each subquestion, 
or so that the problem can be run all at once.

Additional scripts are called within these three problems and are included in this repository folder as well
-gradEb.m
-gradEs.m
-hessEb.m
-hessEs.m
